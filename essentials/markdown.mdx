## Titles

Best used for section headers in your Aqualink documentation.

```md
## Player Management
```

### Subtitles

Best used for subsection headers like specific features or methods.

```md
### Creating a Connection
```

<Tip>
Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on the right, making it easy for developers to navigate your Aqualink docs.
</Tip>

## Text formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide)` to [Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide).

Links to pages in your Aqualink docs need to be root-relative. Include the entire folder path. For example, `[Player API](/api-reference/player)` links to the Player API reference page.

```md
[Quick Start Guide](/quickstart)
[Player Methods](/api-reference/player)
[Audio Filters](/guides/filters)
```

Relative links like `[Player API](../player)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

## Code Examples

Since Aqualink is a code library, you'll frequently need to show code examples:

### Inline Code

Use backticks for inline code: `client.aqua.createConnection()` or `player.play()`.

```md
Use the `client.aqua.createConnection()` method to create a new player.
```

### Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for code blocks with syntax highlighting:

    ```javascript
    const player = client.aqua.createConnection({
        guildId: interaction.guild.id,
        textChannel: interaction.channel.id,
        voiceChannel: interaction.member.voice.channel.id
    });

    await player.play(track);
    ```

### Discord.js Integration Examples

For complete bot command examples, use this format:

    ```javascript
    client.on('interactionCreate', async (interaction) => {
        if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;
        
        if (interaction.commandName === 'play') {
            const query = interaction.options.getString('song');
            const player = client.aqua.createConnection({
                guildId: interaction.guild.id,
                textChannel: interaction.channel.id,
                voiceChannel: interaction.member.voice.channel?.id
            });
            
            const results = await player.search(query);
            if (results.tracks.length > 0) {
                await player.play(results.tracks[0]);
                interaction.reply(`ðŸŽµ Now playing: **${results.tracks[0].title}**`);
            }
        }
    });
    ```

## Blockquotes

### Single line

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> The Aqualink library provides seamless integration with Discord.js for music bot development.

```md
> The Aqualink library provides seamless integration with Discord.js for music bot development.
```

### Multiline

> Aqualink wraps the powerful Lavalink audio server to provide high-quality music streaming.
>
> It includes built-in queue management, audio filters, and failover support for production bots.

```md
> Aqualink wraps the powerful Lavalink audio server to provide high-quality music streaming.
>
> It includes built-in queue management, audio filters, and failover support for production bots.
```

## Music Bot Specific Formatting

### Bot Commands

When documenting slash commands, use this format:

```md
**Command:** `/play <song>`
**Description:** Play a song or add it to the queue
**Usage:** `/play Never Gonna Give You Up`
```

### Configuration Examples

For configuration objects, use proper JSON formatting:

```json
{
  "nodes": [{
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 2333,
    "password": "youshallnotpass"
  }],
  "defaultSearchPlatform": "ytsearch",
  "leaveOnEnd": true
}
```

### Event Documentation

Document events with clear formatting:

**Event:** `trackStart`  
**Emitted:** When a track begins playing  
**Parameters:** `track` (Track object)

```javascript
player.on('trackStart', (track) => {
    console.log(`Now playing: ${track.title}`);
});
```

## Tips for Aqualink Documentation

<Tip>
When documenting methods, always include both the method signature and a practical example showing how it would be used in a Discord bot.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Remember to mention any prerequisites like voice channel permissions or Lavalink server requirements in your documentation.
</Warning>

<Note>
Use consistent formatting for all your API documentation to make it easy for developers to understand and implement Aqualink in their bots.
