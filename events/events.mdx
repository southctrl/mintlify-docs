## All Events

AquaLink emits a variety of events to keep you informed about the state of your music players and Lavalink nodes. You can listen for these events to build a responsive and interactive bot.

## Player Events

### Track Events

```javascript Track Start
client.aqua.on('trackStart', (player, track) => {
    console.log(`Started playing: ${track.title}`);

        description: `**${track.title}**\nBy ${track.author}`,
        color: 0x00ff00

```

## Node Events

### Connection Events

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node Connect
client.aqua.on('nodeConnect', (node) => {
    console.log(`‚úÖ Node ${node.name} connected`);
    console.log(`Node stats: ${node.stats.players} players, ${node.stats.playingPlayers} playing`);
    
    console.log(`Node ${node.name} (${node.host}:${node.port}) is ready!`);
});
```

```javascript Node Disconnect
client.aqua.on('nodeDisconnect', (node, reason) => {
    console.log(`‚ùå Node ${node.name} disconnected: ${reason}`);
    
    if (reason.code === 1006) {
        console.log('Node disconnected abnormally, attempting reconnect...');
    }
    
    console.warn(`Lavalink node ${node.name} is offline!`);
});
```

```javascript Node Destroy
client.aqua.on('nodeDestroy', (node) => {

});
```

```javascript Node Error
client.aqua.on('nodeError', (node, error) => {
    console.error(`‚ùå Node ${node.name} error:`, error);
    
    console.error(`Error details:`, {
        node: node.name,
        host: node.host,
        port: node.port,
        error: error.message,
        stack: error.stack

    if (error.code === 'ECONNREFUSED') {
        console.log('Connection refused, check if Lavalink server is running');
    }
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Event Usage Examples

### Building a Status System

```javascript Complete Status Tracking
const playerStates = new Map();

client.aqua.on('trackStart', (player, track) => {
    playerStates.set(player.guildId, {
        status: 'playing',
        track: track,
        startTime: Date.now()
    });
});

client.aqua.on('trackEnd', (player, track, payload) => {
    const state = playerStates.get(player.guildId);
    if (state) {
        state.status = 'idle';
        state.lastTrack = track;
        state.endReason = payload.reason;
    }
});

client.aqua.on('playerDestroy', (guildId) => {
    playerStates.delete(guildId);
});
```

### Auto-Moderation System

```javascript Auto Skip Bad Tracks
const errorCounts = new Map();

client.aqua.on('trackError', (player, track, payload) => {
    const trackId = track.encoded;
    const count = errorCounts.get(trackId) || 0;
    errorCounts.set(trackId, count + 1);
    
    if (count >= 2) {
        console.log(`Track ${track.title} has errored ${count + 1} times, removing from queue`);
        player.queue = player.queue.filter(t => t.encoded !== trackId);
    }
    
    player.skip();
});
```

### Health Monitoring

```javascript Node Health Monitor
client.aqua.on('nodeConnect', (node) => {
    console.log(`Node ${node.name} online - Health check starting`);
    
    const healthCheck = setInterval(() => {
        if (node.connected) {
            console.log(`${node.name} Stats:`, {
                players: node.stats.players,
                playing: node.stats.playingPlayers,
                uptime: node.stats.uptime,
                memory: `${Math.round(node.stats.memory.used / 1024 / 1024)}MB`
            });
        } else {
            clearInterval(healthCheck);
        }
    }, 30000); 
});

client.aqua.on('nodeDisconnect', (node) => {
    console.warn(`üö® Node ${node.name} went offline! Failover procedures initiated.`);
});
```

<Warning>
Remember to handle events gracefully and avoid blocking the event loop with heavy operations. Use `setImmediate()` or `process.nextTick()` for intensive tasks within event handlers.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Events are emitted in real-time, making them perfect for building live status displays, logging systems, and responsive user interfaces. Combine multiple events to create comprehensive monitoring and control systems.
